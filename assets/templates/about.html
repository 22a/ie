<div class="lightGradient header">About Me</div><br>
My name is <span ng-controller="DateController"> {{(date | date:'yyyy') - 1995}} </span> and I'm Peter years old. I'm currently studying Computer Science at <a class="miscLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.tcd.ie">Trinity College Dublin</a>. There are other things that I will write later.
