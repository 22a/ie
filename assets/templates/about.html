<div class="lightGradient header">About Me</div><br>
My name is <span ng-controller="DateController">{{year}}</span> and I'm Peter years old. 
I'm currently studying Computer Science at <a class="miscLink" target="_blank" href="http://www.tcd.ie">Trinity College Dublin</a>. 
I like many things. Things are good.
